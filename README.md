# Redirect
A Google Chrome Extension to keep the distracted on track

Ever been doing homework and distracted away to a random site that catches your eye? Ever been redirected accidentally by a hidden advertisement? Ever wish you could just stay focused, and that someone (or something) could nudge you in the right direction?

Redirect is designed to redirect you back when you get off task. Just add to Google Chrome and get back to work!
